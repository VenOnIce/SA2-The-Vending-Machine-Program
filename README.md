# SA2-The-Vending-Machine-Program
Summative Assessment 2 for Introduction to Programming

Upon downloading the zip file, most of the files are there as placeholders. The only files that are relevant to the Summative Assessment is:
script.rpy (For the coding itself),
custom_screen.rpy (The status menu on the bottom right of the vending machine screen, displaying True or False statements),
GUI_screens.rpy (Vending Machine GUI that uses the if/elif/else condition command upon interaction, on par with custom_screen.rpy),
custom_script.rpy. (Dialogue, most of the content is irrelevant)

Take note that the files that are fully accessible and readable are the .rpy files NOT the .rpyc files, this one is in charge of executing the code within the game itself.
